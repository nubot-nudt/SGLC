# 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Framework

    <font color=#a0a0a0 size=2>It first builds a semantic graph for foreground instances and then generates LiDAR scan descriptor considering both the topological properties of the semantic graph and the appearance characteristics of the background. The LiDAR scan descriptor is utilized to retrieve loop candidate scans from the database. Following this,  geometric verification is performed on each loop candidate to filter out false loop closure, with the key step utilizing the instance node descriptors for robust sparse node matching. Finally, a coarse-fine-refine registration scheme is employed to estimate the precise 6-DoF pose.</font>

# 2. Prerequisites

We tested our code on **ubuntu 20.04** and **ubuntu 18.04**. 

- **[Eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/releases) (3.3.7)**
- **[PCL](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/releases) (1.10)**
- **[Ceres-solver](https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/tags) (2.1.0)**

You need to install these libraries from official guidance.'

# 3. Data

### 1. KITTI

You can download the point cloud dataset from the KITTI official [website](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/), as well as the labels from the semanticKITTI [website](http://semantic-kitti.org/). In our experiments, we use the labels from the SegNet4D. For the convenience, you can download from [here](https://1drv.ms/f/c/5f06ab4eccad8a4e/ErYFBreLgOZHqeWc2-WasIAB6sdME03IipgqzkYuRsTDZg?e=sL1yBr).

Loop pairs: we use the distance-based criteria from the [SSC](https://github.com/lilin-hitcrt/SSC) and overlap-based criteria from [OverlapTransformer](https://github-com-s.libyc.nudt.edu.cn/haomo-ai/OverlapTransformer). You also can download from our [link](https://1drv.ms/f/c/5f06ab4eccad8a4e/ErYFBreLgOZHqeWc2-WasIAB6sdME03IipgqzkYuRsTDZg?e=sL1yBr).

### 2. KITTI360

Download the LiDAR scans from the official [website](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti-360/). We provide the labels from SegNet4D.

### 3. Ford campus

You can follow the [OverlapTransformer](https://github-com-s.libyc.nudt.edu.cn/haomo-ai/OverlapTransformer) to download the dataset. We provide the labels on the [link](https://1drv.ms/f/c/5f06ab4eccad8a4e/ErYFBreLgOZHqeWc2-WasIAB6sdME03IipgqzkYuRsTDZg?e=sL1yBr).

### 4. Apollo

We use the Apollo Columbia Park MapData proposed by [AutoMOS](). You can download it from the [MapMOS](https://github.com/PRBonn/MapMOS?tab=readme-ov-file) repository. The semantic labels can be found in the [link](https://1drv.ms/f/c/5f06ab4eccad8a4e/ErYFBreLgOZHqeWc2-WasIAB6sdME03IipgqzkYuRsTDZg?e=sL1yBr).

## 4. Usage

### 4.1 Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nubot-nudt/SGLC.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```

### 4.2 Loop Closure Detection

- **demo data**

```
cd /SGLC/bin
./eval_lcd_pair
```

- **KITTI dataset (distance-based)** 

Modify `config/config_kitti_graph.yaml`

```yaml
eval_seq:
  cloud_path: "xx/kitti/sequences/08/velodyne/" # your LiDAR scans
  label_path: "xx/SegNet4D_predicitions/kitti/sequences/08/predictions/" # semantic predictions from our link
  pairs_file: "../loop_data/pairs/pairs_kitti/neg_100/08.txt" # loop pairs
  out_file: "../out/kitti/08.txt"  # output file for evaluating
```

Then, you can run the `.bin` file following this:

```bash
cd /SGLC/bin
./eval_lcd_seq
```

you can find the output file in the `SGLC/out/`. for evaluating, you can run:

```bash
cd /SGCL/scripts
python pr_curve.py
```

- **KITTI dataset (overlap-based)**

Modify `config/config_kitti_graph.yaml`

```yaml
eval_overlap:
  cloud_path: "xx/kitti/sequences/00/velodyne/"
  label_path: "xx/SegNet4D_predicitions/kitti/sequences/00/predictions/"
  out_pair_file: "../out/kitti/00_overlap_pairs.txt"
  out_pair_veri_file: "../out/kitti/00_overlap_pairs_veri.txt"
```

Then, you can run the `.bin` file following this:

```
cd /SGLC/bin
./eval_overlap
```

For evaluation:

```bash
cd /SGCL/scripts
python eval_overlap_dataset.py --dataset kitti --gt_file loop_gt_seq00_0.3overlap_inactive.npz --preb_file ../out/kitti/00_overlap_pairs_veri.txt
```

Download gt_file from our link in the Data.

- **KITTI-360, Ford_campus and Apollo**

Similarly, follow this KITTI instructions.

Distance-based:

```bash
./eval_lcd_seq_kitti360
```

Overlap-based

```
./eval_overlap_apollo
./eval_overlap_ford_campus
```

### 4.3 Loop Poses Estimation

- **KITTI**

Modify `config/config_kitti_graph.yaml`

```YAML
eval_poses:
  cloud_path: "xx/kitti/sequences/08/velodyne/"
  label_path: "xx/SegNet4D_predicitions/kitti/sequences/08/predictions/"
  loop_poses_file: "xx/loop_data/loop/loop_distance4/08.txt" # gt_file, you can download from our link
  out_file: "../out/kitti/loop_distance4_08.txt" # output file
```

Then, run the `.bin` file

```
cd /SGLC/bin
./eval_loo_poses
```

For evaluation:

```bash
cd /SGLC/scripts
python eval_loop_poses.py --dataset kitti --gt_poses xx/loop_data/loop/loop_distance4/08.txt --preb_file ../out/kitti/loop_distance4_08.txt
```
